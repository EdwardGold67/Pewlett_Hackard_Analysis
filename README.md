# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview of Project
A manager has given three assignments: to determine the number of retiring employees per title, identify the number of employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program and lastly, to help prepare the manager for the upcoming "silver tsunami". For the analysis, I have used the data tools PostgreSQL, pgAdmin python and Visual Studio Code.

## Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
Using PostgreSQL, I created and executed a query to make a retirement titles table for employeers who are born between Jauanry 1, 1952 and Deember 31 1955. The retirement table syntax and table can be seen below.
